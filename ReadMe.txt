Steps:

1. Clone (or download) the base project from github: https://github.com/ArenMook/P5SMod

2. This is a Unity project, so install Unity 5.6.5p1 from here: https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases
   It's important to install the exact version, or your results may vary. Using a later version of 5.6
   cycle should probably be fine, but using Unity 2017 or 2018 will most certainly break things.

3. You can now use the project as-is to write scripts for the game. Alternatively, you can download one of
   the example mods from here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xq2gn6jthc2xt3k/AAAKlZUwh-Uzfc5DgFJwCiV4a?dl=0
   Simply choose a mod and save its entire folder under your project's Assets folder.

4. Open the base project with Unity and have fun! To export a mod, select the assets that should be
   exported (or the folder they reside in) in the Project view, then use the
   Assets -> DataNode -> Export Selected menu. You will want to export the assets into the
   My Documents/Sightseer/Mods/<Your Mod Name> folder. You can then play your mod by launching the game.
